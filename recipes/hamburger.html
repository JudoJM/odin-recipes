        <li>Season the burger patties with salt and pepper to taste on both sides.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers in the hot skillet or grill. Cook each side for about 3-4 minutes, 
            depending on the thickness of the burger and your desired level of doneness (medium, well-done, etc.).
            Flip the burgers only once.
        </li>
        <li>While the burgers are cooking, prepare additional ingredients: slice the tomato thinly, slice the onion 
            thinly, and separate the lettuce leaves.
        </li>
        <li>When the burgers are almost done, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty and let it melt slightly.</li>
        <li>Lightly toast the burger buns in the skillet or a toaster.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burger: place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of the bun, followed by the burger patty 
            with melted cheese, then add tomato and onion slices. Add ketchup and mustard to taste on the 
            top half of the bun, then cover the burger with the other half of the bun.
